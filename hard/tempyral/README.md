(PWN) (HARD) (EVAN) Tempyral
Description:
I’m trying to find the password to this, but I can’t figure it out. It seems like some passwords take longer than others…
Solution:
It is a side channel timing attack. Make a script to try a bunch of stuff, character by character, and find the one with the longest response time
